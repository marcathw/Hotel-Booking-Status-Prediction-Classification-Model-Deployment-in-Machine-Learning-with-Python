# üè® Hotel Booking Status Prediction Using Classification Models in Python

This machine learning project predicts whether a hotel booking will be confirmed or not using classification models. Two algorithms‚ÄîRandom Forest and XGBoost‚Äîare compared, and the best model is deployed via Streamlit for interactive prediction.
